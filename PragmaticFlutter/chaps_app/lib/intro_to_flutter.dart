The iOS applications are developed using either Objective-C 
or Swift programming languages. The Android applications are

JavaScript + W eb V iew
One solution for developing cross-platform applications from a 
single code is to use JavaScript with WebView(s). A WebView is 
a part of the browser’s engine that can be inserted into a Native 
app along with loading web content in it.

Front - end & Backend Using Dart
Flutter apps are written using the Dart language. The same programming 
language can also be used to build the backend for the application. 
Developing front-end and backend in the same language helps with 
the cost and developers’ familiarity with both sides of the app development.
